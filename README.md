# Shopping Website Purchase Prediction

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict whether a user visiting a shopping website will make a purchase based on input data from a CSV file. It explores various machine learning models, with the highest accuracy achieved using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. This repository contains the code, dataset, and relevant documentation to replicate and understand the prediction process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopping-purchase-prediction.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd shopping-purchase-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Place your input data in a CSV file. Ensure it contains relevant features (e.g., user behavior on the website).

2. Update the file path and data preprocessing steps in the Jupyter Notebook provided.

### Training the Model

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `shopping-purchase-prediction.ipynb`.

2. Run the notebook cells to load the data, preprocess it, and train the machine learning model.

### Making Predictions

1. After training the model, you can use it to make predictions on new data. Modify the input data as required and apply the trained model to predict purchase behavior.
